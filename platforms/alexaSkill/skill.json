					"description": "El 16 de abril de 2018, manifestantes marcharon en la capital de Managua para protestar contra lo que consideraban una respuesta insuficiente del gobierno a los incendios forestales que quemaron 13,500 acres (5.500 hectáreas) de la Reserva Biológica Indio Maíz, una reserva natural tropical que es hogar de Ramas y los indígenas Kriol, así como especies importantes de biodiversidad y en peligro de extinción. Las contra-protestas apoyaron al gobierno del Frente Sandinista.\n\nEl miércoles 18 de abril, las protestas en la capital se expandieron en respuesta al anuncio del gobierno de Ortega-Murillo de reformas de la seguridad social que aumentaron los impuestos a la nómina y los ingresos al tiempo que reducían las pensiones en un 5%. Las manifestaciones también surgieron en seis ciudades más, y se encontraron con una fuerte respuesta de las autoridades tras el despliegue del ejército nicaragüense para responder a los manifestantes ordenados por el presidente Ortega. Al menos 26 personas murieron, incluido el periodista Ángel Gahona, del programa de noticias Meridiano, y Gahona fue asesinado a tiros fuera del ayuntamiento de Bluefields mientras transmitía en vivo en Facebook. También surgieron informes que varios medios independientes fueron censurados durante las protestas.\n\nAsí es como todo comenzó.
